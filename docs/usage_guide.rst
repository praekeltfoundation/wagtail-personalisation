Creating a segment
------------------

As soon as the installation is completed and configured, the module will be
visible in the Wagtail administrative area.

To create a segment, go to the "Segments" page and click on "Add a new segment".

On this page you will be presented with a form. Follow these steps to create a
new segment:

1. Enter a name for your segment.

2. (Optional) Select whether to match any or all defined rules.

    ``match any`` will result in a segment that is applied as soon as one of
    your rules matches the visitor. When ``match all`` is selected, all rules
    must match before the segment is applied.

3. (Optional) Set the segment persistence.

    When persistence is enabled, your segment will stick to the visitor once
    applied, even if the rules no longer match on the next visit.

4. (Optional) Choose whether the segment is static or dynamic.

    Static segments will store which visitors have matched them. Dynamic
    segments will not keep track of which visitors have matched them.

    4.2 (Static segments) Set a count for a static segment.
        Static segments will stop testing visitors against their rules when
        ```count`` users have been added to the segment.

4. Define your segment rules.

    Wagxperience comes with a basic set of :doc:`default_rules` that allow
    you to get started quickly. The rules you define will be evaluated once a
    visitor makes a request to your application.

5. Save your segment.

    Click "save" to store your segment. It will be enabled by default,
    unless otherwise defined.


Creating personalized content
-----------------------------

Once you've created a segment you can start serving these visitors with
personalised content. To do this, you can go one of two directions.

1. Create a copy of a page for your segment.

2. Create StreamField blocks only visible to your segment.

3. Create a template block only visible to your segment.


Method 1: Create a copy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a copy from a page for a specific Segment (which you can change to
your liking after copying it) simply go to the Explorer section and find the
page you'd wish to personalize.

You'll notice a new "Variants" dropdown button has appeared. Click the button
and select the segment you'd like to create personalized content for.

Once you've selected the segment, a copy of the page will be created with a
title that includes the segment. Don't worry, your visitors won't be able to
see this title.

You can change everything on this page you'd like. Visitors that are included in
your segment, will automatically see the new page you've created for them.


Method 2: Create a StreamField block
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Method 3: Create a template block
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can add a template block that only shows its contents to users of a
specific segment. This is done using the "segment" block.

When editing templates make sure to load the ``wagtail_personalisation_tags``
tags library in the template::

    {% load wagtail_personalisation_tags %}

After that you can add a template block with the name of the segment you want
the content to show up for::

    {% segment name="My Segment" %}
        <p>Only users within "My Segment" see this!</p>
    {% endsegment %}

The template block currently only supports one segment at a time. If you want
to target multiple segments you will have to make multiple blocks with the
same content.
